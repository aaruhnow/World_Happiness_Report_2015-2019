## Introduction

#### The World Happiness Report evaluates global happiness by ranking countries according to their happiness levels. Participants in the World Gallup Poll rate their current lives on a scale from zero to ten, with ten representing the best possible life. The report also examines six key factors—Economy (GDP per Capita), Family, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust (Government Corruption), and Generosity—to understand their impact on life evaluations in each country. By using happiness as a metric and analyzing the factors that most significantly influence it, governments can better prioritize the well-being of their citizens.  This analysis is going to determine which of the six factors Economy (GDP per capita), Family, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust (Government Corruption), and Generosity contribute the most and the least to happieness scores.

## Data Source

#### The four data sets range from 2015-2019 and were downloaded from Kaggle an external data source.  The data was created by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network a non-profit organization that was created and funded by the United Nations.  Since this data was created by a non-profit and is associated with the United Nations, this data is considered trustworthy.

## Data Collection

#### The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.  The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll and are based off the answer to the Cantril Ladder question in the poll.  This question asks respondents to think of a ladder with a range of 0-10.  10 being the best possible life and 0 being the worst possible life and to rate their own current lives based on that range.  

## Data Contents

#### Each of the 5 data sets are based off a year (2015-2019) and each contain similar columns and values.

## Data Relevancy

#### The data sets are relevant to the project’s objectives.  The data meets the requirements outlined in the project brief and will allow me to build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing different factors influencing happiness in different countries.  This will offer valuable insights to both citizens and policymakers, helping them understand the factors that impact happiness around the world.

## Data Choice

#### I chose The World Happiness Report because I believe I can learn a lot of valuable information through analysis of these data sets as well as how happiness compares to different countries and why.  I didn’t know there was a happiness report out there so I’m curious to what I find in this analysis and what the end results will look like.

## Data Analysis Questions

#### 1. What is the distribution of happiness scores across different countries?

#### 2. How does Economy (GDP) correlate with the happiness score?

#### 3. Is there a correlation between Trust (Government Corruption) and Happiness Score?

#### 4. Is there a correlation between Family (Social Support) and happiness score?

#### 5. Which of the 6 factors impact the Happiness Score the most?

#### 6. Which of the 6 factors impact the Happiness Scores the least?

#### 7. What are the top 10 happiest countries?

#### 8. What are the top 10 least happiest countries?
